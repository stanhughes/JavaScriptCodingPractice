The purpose of this code is to create two functions.

One that return integers from 1 to 5. The second function uses the
first to return a number between 1 to 7.

An interesting note is that it seems like ones are less likely.

Also seems like sevens are less likely.

Ones only consist of a 1 and a 0; only one why to get a one.

Same for sevens.

Possible ways to get each Number

Ones, 1 + 0

Twos, 1 + 1, 2 + 0

Threes, 1 + 2, 2 + 1, 3 + 0

Fours, 2 + 2, 3 + 1, 4 + 0

Fives, 3 + 2, 4 + 1, 5 + 0

Sixes, 4 + 2, 5 + 1, 6 + 0

Sevens, 6 + 1

1/16 chance for a one or 7 (2/16)

2/16 change for a Two (2/16)

3/16 changes for a three, four, five or six (12/16)
